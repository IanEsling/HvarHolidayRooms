        <p>All of our beautiful rooms are en-suite and are individually decorated and furnished, accomodating 2 people.
            We are situated in recently renovated traditional old stone buildings in the peaceful little ancient village
            of Dol in the hills at the centre of the island,
            all the facilities and sights that Hvar has to offer are within easy reach yet we're far enough off the
            tourist trail for you to experience life in the real Hvar.</p>

        <p>Dol is the ideal base from which to explore the island, especially the hundreds of secluded beaches that lie
        along the whole coast of Hvar.  From the more popular resorts at Vrboska and Jelsa to the smaller coves at little
        towns like Basina or just heading off down the numerous little side roads to see what lies at the end you can
        guarantee swimming and diving in beautiful crystal clear waters wherever you go.</p>

        <p>We can serve breakfast in the mornings if required, we have a large Konaba (Kitchen) that can cater for groups
        or there are plenty of local markets and supermarkets nearby for self-catering, each room is equipped with its
            own fridge.</p>

        <p>The nearest town is Stari Grad, a 5 minute drive or scooter ride away.  Situated on the sea front with a large
            variety of bars, shops and restaurants it's a popular destination with locals and tourists alike.
            The main ferry port is also a 5 minute drive away and the other big towns of the island, Hvar Town and Jelsa
            are an easy 15 minute drive away.</p>
