            <p class="q">How do I get to Dol?</p>

            <p class="a">easyJet and WizzAir both fly to Split International airport, from there a coach service leaves
                every 30 mins to the harbour in Split town (approx 30 minute journey) where you can catch the ferry to
                Stari Grad on Hvar, Dol is a 5 minute car journey from there either by taxi or we'll come and pick you
                up.</p>

            <p class="q">How do I get around Hvar?</p>

            <p class="a">There are lots of options depending on how much exploring you want to do! Cars and scooters are
                readily available for hire on the island as well as bicycles. We have scooters available for hire as
                well on
                a more casual basis, although there are plenty of beautiful walks in the hills around Dol and the town
                of Stari Grad is a half-hour walk away if you wish to keep things more peaceful.
            </p>

            <p class="q">What meals are provided?</p>

            <p class="a">We provide breakfast in the mornings, although we can provide packed lunches and evening meals by
                arrangement
                for a small charge.
                There are fridges in the rooms and supermarkets in nearby Stari Grad and restaurants for all budgets are
                plentiful and of a high quality both in the main towns as well as the little villages off the main
                tourist trail.</p>
