            <p class="q">How do I get to Dol?</p>

            <p class="a">GermanWings, easyJet, WizzAir and Croatia Air all fly to Split International airport,
                from there a coach service leaves
                every 30 mins to the harbour in Split town (approx 30 minute journey) where you can catch the ferry to
                Stari Grad on Hvar. Alternatively there's a hydrofoil to Hvar from Pescara, Ancona in Italy that takes
                about 4 hours.
                Dol is a 5 minute car journey from there either by taxi or we'll come and pick you
                up.</p>

            <p class="q">How do I get around Hvar?</p>

            <p class="a">There are lots of options depending on how much exploring you want to do! Cars and scooters are
                readily available for hire on the island as well as bicycles. We have scooters available for hire as
                well on
                a more casual basis, although there are plenty of beautiful walks in the hills around Dol and the town
                of Stari Grad is a half-hour walk away if you wish to keep things more peaceful.
            </p>

            <p class="q">What meals are provided?</p>

            <p class="a">We provide big breakfasts in the mornings and can arrange evening drinks and meals
                by
                arrangement
                for a small charge. There are supermarkets in nearby Stari Grad and restaurants for all budgets are
                plentiful and of a high quality both in the main towns as well as the little villages off the main
                tourist trail.</p>

            <p class="q">Where can I find more information about Hvar and Dol?</p>

            <p class="a">The <a href="http://www.tzhvar.hr/en/">Hvar Tourist Board website</a>
                (in several languages including English) has
                a lot of information about Hvar Town including travel advice and a virtual walk!<br>
